# Hard Drive Failure Prediction

In this project, we try to build a model to predict the number of days till Hard Drive fails.

The code is present in Predicting_Drive_Failure.ipynb

The notebook can be downloaded and run on Google Colab, no extra steps are required.

The data is taken from BackBlaze, https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-storage/resources/hard-drive-test-data#downloadingTheRawTestData

I have used data from the entire year of 2016, Q1-Q3 as train data and Q4 as test data. The choice of the year is purely arbitrary.
